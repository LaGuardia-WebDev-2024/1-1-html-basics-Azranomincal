<h1> The teenage dream
  <h2> Azra curry
    <p> I had dreams of growing up <br>
      everyone made it seem so nice<br>
      i tried to make the time go fast<br>
      and now i have to pay the price<br>
      i should've experienced being a kid<br>
      now look at all the trouble im in<br>
      like a branch with thorn<br>
      and my brain thats torn<br>
      caught between too grown and to young<br>
      the cat has got tangled and caught on my tongue. </p>
    
    </p>
